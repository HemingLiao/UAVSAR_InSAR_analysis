# UAVSAR InSAR analysis
## this code performs a wide array of UAVSAR analysis, including:
### (1) UAVSAR time series amplitude analysis
### (2) UAVSAR multitemporal nSAR coherence map analysis
### (3) Statistic of UAVSAR coherence vs phase, different polarimetric channel phase difference, with application in different vegetation coverages.
